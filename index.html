<h1>If I die tomorrow, how will I feel?</h1>

<h2><strong>A Text Conversation: February 3rd-4th, 2025</strong></h2>
A: Yo dude, I was reading some news articles about meta working closely trump/removing their content moderation policies. and it reminded me of your job search. I feel like you’re someone who cares a lot about people and bringing good into the world, and I didn’t know if you knew about all that happening at meta  Not trying to say that every other tech company is inherently good or bad, but meta has a large impact (like swinging the 2016 election in the data harvesting scandal) and the software engineers are implementing the decisions the leadership makes. I thought you might care about considering this if you end up having to decide to take a job there.
<br><br>
B: I haven't read this article but I started hearing all this stuff recently and a lot about the company has started to make me question it
It started after I got the final round so I was already invested but it's honestly made me be not very excited about it
<br>
I appreciate you thinking of me tho
<br>
I think I mentally decided that at least for now I'm gonna keep going thru with the interview and will really think about it if I even get an offer. At the very least it'll be a great practice round hahah
<br><br>
A: Yeah dude obv no judgement I’m not trying to control your recruiting process LOL it was just that I felt a need to share what i knew - like so it sat well with me
<br><br>
B: I was actually mentioning the other day that all this shit that meta is doing is wild
<br>
Nahhh I feel that I just appreciate you telling me
<br>
I think the removing DEI, removing fact checking, cutting bottom 5%, and saying that we wanna bring more masculine energy to meta are all huge red flags Lmfaoo
<br>
Also kinda think it's funny how much people don't give a shit
<br><br>
A: Yeah I feel like it can be really easy for ppl in tech to actively ignore their duty to care about what the work they do is and what goals it’s serving in the world.
<br>
And also it’s just easy for us to think that what’s going on in the US right now doesn’t matter because it doesn’t immediately affect us or because we have a lot of money
<br><br>
B: Yeah that's true it's honestly been an internal debate i have sometimes. This might sound silly but trying to figure out how to navigate it. Kinda like these things are scary and stressful, but at the end of the day is it even worth it for me to be scared or take on this stress? This def sounds privileged, but what can I even do that's gonna help here and is within my means? Of course helping friends and family however I can is a given, but outside of that what do I even need to do. I'd love to talk to you about it one day, cuz I'm pretty sure these questions come from ignorance.
<br><br>
A: Nah dude that question isn’t silly at all and also I don’t think you’re an ignorant privileged guy. Honestly same everyday I think about the same thing and where my line is between my comfort vs my integrity.
<br>
I do think there’s a lot that we can do within our means, and that doesn’t mean we make ourselves uncomfortable. Any action is doing something regardless of how small. I feel like giving up hope that there’s nothing we can do is the real problem and that’s what ends up leading to ignorance (like it’s not that ppl don’t care, but that they don’t think anything they do will matter)
<br>
Tbh I think the only responsibility we have (and I think everyone does) is to continuously challenge ourselves to make ourselves slightly bit more less comfortable in exchange for standing up for our values (just small things like me sending that initial text to you or shopping at a thrift store or donating $20 more month after month whatever it is).
<br><br>
B: I think like between comfort and integrity is actually a really good perspective that I hadn't been able to simplify down to before.
<br><br>
A: Hahaha it’s the way I look at it, but not the only way to
<br><br>

<h2><strong>A Journal Entry: February 1st, 2025</strong></h2>
Just like that the first month of 2025 is gone, yeah I should really work right now but I don’t really want to. Now that I completed my budget, I see what my life is like if I save $3K a month - and it’s really not that bad at all? It’s funny how my life feels really similar to __. It’s crazy that extra money I spent on leisure doesn’t really change at all. Change my lifestyle that is. But god am I tired of the food I’m making at this point. Maybe I should start eating like.. cold cereal, chickpeas, dal? I’m interested in eating dal again - and Rajiv’s isn’t that hard to make. I really like that guy - I kinda wanna be like him - he’s undoubtedly himself. At least on camera. What do I need to do next to feel alive? What thing do I need to do next to not feel sad when I die? The Bhagavad Gita really lined up with what Rajiv said about death. I wanna feel like I connect with ambitious people - but I feel like I’m not ambitious anymore. That makes me sad. I want to feel like I want to find my community. Is an MBA really going to do a lot?
<br><br>
If I died tomorrow how will I feel? I’ll feel grateful I felt true love. I'll fell grateful I took a risk. While this job is great - I want to find a community that I want to be a part of. I feel my problem right now is I don’t have a community that I want to be a part of. Or I feel a want for that. I’m enjoying this economic safety. But am I just unambitious or uneducated for not being involved in something? What I’m learning from __’s business is that things can really change - maybe I need to start posting. Things can really grow and change over time. You also need time to really think about things. This is just 1 life I have and I want to enjoy it. What are my reasons for staying in this job?
<br><br>
So the idea I have is literally starting a non-descriptive site and then posting my journals word for word there. Why not just try it and see what happens. Is this like me uploading my brain to the matrix willingly? Yes. But it’s going to fulfill what you said you’re going to do. To take your writing and post it. So that’ll be good. People do crazy things. But this is something crazy you can do. I keep telling myself the reason I stay in this job is because I’m learning a lot, and because the money is good. While I agree both are true - am I truly living? Biding your time is bullshit maybe. There’s no reason to bide your time. Maybe I’m no fun to be around these days anymore. Maybe something interesting to me is working on political campaigns. Well I missed this one. Okay I got more out of this than I thought, it’s just a question of money.
