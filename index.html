Just like that the first month of 2025 is gone, yeah I should really work right now but I don’t really want to. Now that I completed my budget, I see what my life is like if I save $3K a month - and it’s really not that bad at all? It’s funny how my life feels really similar to __. It’s crazy that extra money I spent on leisure doesn’t really change at all. Change my lifestyle that is. But god am I tired of the food I’m making at this point. Maybe I should start eating like.. cold cereal, chickpeas, dal? I’m interested in eating dal again - and Rajiv’s isn’t that hard to make. I really like that guy - I kinda wanna be like him - he’s undoubtedly himself. At least on camera. What do I need to do next to feel alive? What thing do I need to do next to not feel sad when I die? The Bhagavad Gita really lined up with what Rajiv said about death. I wanna feel like I connect with ambitious people - but I feel like I’m not ambitious anymore. That makes me sad. I want to feel like I want to find my community. Is an MBA really going to do a lot?

If I died tomorrow how will I feel? I’ll feel grateful I felt true love. I'll fell grateful I took a risk. While this job is great - I want to find a community that I want to be a part of. I feel my problem right now is I don’t have a community that I want to be a part of. Or I feel a want for that. I’m enjoying this economic safety. But am I just unambitious or uneducated for not being involved in something? What I’m learning from __’s business is that things can really change - maybe I need to start posting. Things can really grow and change over time. You also need time to really think about things. This is just 1 life I have and I want to enjoy it. What are my reasons for staying in this job?
<br><br>
So the idea I have is literally starting a non-descriptive site and then posting my journals word for word there. Why not just try it and see what happens. Is this like me uploading my brain to the matrix willingly? Yes. But it’s going to fulfill what you said you’re going to do. To take your writing and post it. So that’ll be good. People do crazy things. But this is something crazy you can do. I keep telling myself the reason I stay in this job is because I’m learning a lot, and because the money is good. While I agree both are true - am I truly living? Biding your time is bullshit maybe. There’s no reason to bide your time. Maybe I’m no fun to be around these days anymore. Maybe something interesting to me is working on political campaigns. Well I missed this one. Okay I got more out of this than I thought, it’s just a question of money.
